# Views

Views are a powerful feature in atomic that allow for efficient reshaping of `Tensors` without copying the underlying data. A View is a `Tensor` that shares the same memory as the original `Tensor` but with a different shape and stride configuration.

## Creating Views

You can create a view using the `View` method on a `Tensor`. The method takes a new shape as an argument:

```go
original := tensor.NewTensor([]int{3, 2}, []float64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
view := original.View([]int{2, 3})
```

## Memory Sharing

Views are memory-efficient because they don't create a copy of the data. Instead, they use the same underlying memory buffer as the original tensor but interpret it differently based on the new shape and strides.

For example:
```go
// Original tensor (3x2)
original := tensor.NewTensor([]int{3, 2}, []float64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
/*
[
  1 2
  3 4
  5 6
]
*/

// Create a view (2x3)
view := original.View([]int{2, 3})
/*
[
  1 2 3
  4 5 6
]
*/

// Modifying the view affects the original tensor
view.Set([]int{0, 0}, 10)
// Now original[0,0] is also 10
```

## Use Cases

Views are particularly useful for:
1. Reshaping data without copying memory
2. Creating slices or windows of larger tensors
3. Implementing efficient tensor operations that require different shapes

## Limitations

When creating views, keep in mind:
1. The new shape must be compatible with the original tensor's data size
2. The total number of elements must remain the same
3. Views share memory, so modifications to either the view or original tensor affect both
