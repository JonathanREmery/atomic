# atomic
atomic aims to be a full fledged framework for statistical modeling, machine learning, and neural network development. It is written from the ground up in Go.

## Why?
Why reinvent the wheel? Especially when other libraries will have more speed, memory efficiency, and stability. atomic, is meant to force myself to write everything from scratch. No linear algebra libraries, no tensor libraries, no autograd libraries, they are gone, reduced to atoms... This exercise shold lead to a very deep understanding of how machine learning works, as well as give me a better idea of how the most popular ML libraries work under the hood.

## Roadmap
- [] Tensor (operations, broadcasting)
- [] Compute Graphs (data flow, visualizations)
- [] Autograd (gradients, backpropagation)
- [] NN (layers, losses, optimizers)
